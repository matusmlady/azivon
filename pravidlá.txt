1. Players spawn mainly diagonally in corners, but it is all up to you, they should just be evenly placed
2. Every turn you draw on the paper 2 actions (e. g. in the form of lines), you can save up to 20 actions, but you can use max. 10 actions in one turn
3. You expand by counquering fields (tiles).
4. By default, for every action you conquer 1 field, you can jump over one field 
RULES OF CONQUERING
1. Counquered field has that much defence, as the number of conquered surrounding fields + that conquered field
2. Attack force is that big as the number of counquered fields surrounding the field you want to conquer
3. You can conquer the field only when you have more attack force than defence of the field and you have respective number of actions

Some fields have different values of defence and attack than others (but all of them have same amout of attack as defence), we can refer to them as power

Hra končí keď jeden z hráčov už nemôže nič robiť (ani odkladať akcie do skladu.
	Po obsadení spawnu hráč vypadáva, z jeho územia sa stáva NPC – hráč, ktorý však nič nerobí - drzi si vsak pozicie aj obrannu silu
	Spawny sa vyberaju nahodne, každý bez toho aby videl mapu ňou dole hlavou otočí a na záver sa otočí hore.
	Ak je iny pocet hracov ako 4, pocet krajnych policok sa podeli poctom hracov. Takto vzdialeny od seba hraci budu. ?Prvy hrac zacina v rohu.
