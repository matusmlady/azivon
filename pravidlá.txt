1. Players spawn mainly diagonally in corners, but it is all up to you, they should just be evenly placed

RULES OF CONQUERING
1. Counquered field has that much defence, as the number of conquered surrounding fields + that conquered field
2. Attack force is that big as the number of counquered fields surrounding the field you want to conquer
3. You can conquer the field only when you have more attack force than defence of the field and you have respective number of actions

Some fields have different values of defence and attack than others (but all of them have same amout of attack as defence), we can refer to them as power
