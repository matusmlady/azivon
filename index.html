   <p> &emsp; In this section of our website, we will try to explain rules of this beautiful game. (Disclaimer: adjust the rules as you wish! This is mainly for inspiration. Of course feel free to use them.) </p>
  
  <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>The number of players is unlimited.</li>
    <li>Players spawn in corners, and/or they should be evenly placed. They start with this first tile as their only teritory.</li>
    <li>Every turn you receive <b>2</b> actions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4 id="warehouse">Warehouse</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>Each player has a warehouse the size of <b>20</b> actions.</li>
   <li>You use the warehouse by taking notes on the paper where you print your map.</li>
   <li>You can store there one or both of the actions you receive each turn.</li>
   <li>The limit you can save there is actions per turn * 10 = 20.</li>
   <li>You can save up actions in order to create massive pushes on the map.</li>
   <li>The limit of actions you can spend per turn is 10 actions. (That means 2 actions you receive + 8 stored in the warehouse.)</li>
   <li>When you use actions from the warehouse you can simply cross them off of the stored actions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4 id = "expansion">Expansion</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>You expand by counquering tiles.</li> 
   <li>For 1 action you can conquer exactly 1 <b>empty</b> tile.</li>
   <li>You can conquer any tile, that is at maximum 2 tiles (vertically, horizontally, diagonally or these ways combined...) away from your current territory.</li>
   <li>You don't move your teritory, you only expand - conquer other tiles.</li>
   <li>Later in the game you will be able to fight for the territory with other players.</li>
  </ol>
  <!--Tu by bolo možno dobré dať nejakú animáciu rozširovania sa. -->
  
  <h4 id = "conquering">Conquering</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>When fighting, for each tile you can calculate the attack on this tile and also this tile's defence.</li>
   <li>A file without elements has in default the power of 1. That means it's defense - supporting the tile itself and supporting adjacent tiles is 1 and it's attack on adjacent tiles is 1 as well.</li>
   <li>By default, the defender has a defence of 1, because of the tile itself having this basic defence.</li>
   <li>The defending tile has support from every adjacent friendly tile, for each tile it is 1 extra support = defence. ?support from other players vs combined attack; diplomacy; alances</li> <!-- tá veta začínajuca otáznikam je už finálna verzia aelbo sa to má ešte upravovať xd? -->
   <li>The attacker on the other hand, has 1 attack strength for each adjacent attacking tile.</li>
   <li>This means that only the adjacent tiles are counted when calculating the attacker's strength and the defender's defence. Also the defender has always one extra defence for the tile itself.</li>
   <li>When talking about adjacent tiles, we mean the diagonally adjacent tiles as well.</li>
   <li>Any field is conquerable only when the attacker's power is greater than the defender's defence.</li>
   <li>For conquering a field of another player, you need to use the number of actions the first owner used to conquer this tile. For a tile without elements or features, this is one.</li>
