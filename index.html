   <p>    In this section of our website, we will try to explain rules of this beautiful game.</p>
  <p><h4>Setup</h4>   Every player starts in the <b>corner</b> of the map. If two players are playing, their starting positions are diagonally opposite.</p>
  <p><h4>Actions</h4>   On the start of every turn, you get <b>two</b> "actions". You can do basically two things with your actions:</p>
   <p>    Firstly, you can just store it in the storage, which means that you will save them for next time.You can save up to 20 actions, but you can use max. 10 actions in one turn.</p>
   <p>    The second thing you can do with actions is conquering fields up to two fields away from the territory you control.
