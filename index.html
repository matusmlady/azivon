   <p> &emsp; In this section of our website, we will try to explain rules of this beautiful game. (Disclaimer: adjust the rules as you wish! This is mainly for inspiration. Of course feel free to use them.) </p>
  
  <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>The number of players is unlimited.</li>
    <li>Players spawn in corners, and/or they should be evenly placed. They start with this first tile as their only teritory.</li>
    <li>Every turn you receive <b>2</b> actions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4 id="warehouse">Warehouse</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>Each player has a warehouse the size of <b>20</b> actions.</li>
   <li>You use the warehouse by taking notes on the paper where you print your map.</li>
   <li>You can store there one or both of the actions you receive each turn.</li>
   <li>The limit you can save there is actions per turn * 10 = 20.</li>
   <li>You can save up actions in order to create massive pushes on the map.</li>
   <li>The limit of actions you can spend per turn is 10 actions. (That means 2 actions you receive + 8 stored in the warehouse.)</li>
   <li>When you use actions from the warehouse you can simply cross them off of the stored actions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><h4 id = "expansion">Expansion</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>You expand by counquering tiles.</li> 
   <li>For 1 action you can conquer exactly 1 <b>empty</b> tile.</li>
   <li>You can conquer any tile, that is at maximum 2 tiles (vertically, horizontally, diagonally or these ways combined...) away from your current territory.</li>
   <li>You don't move your teritory, you only expand - conquer other tiles.</li>
   <li>Later in the game you will be able to fight for the territory with other players.</li>
