   <p> &emsp; In this section of our website, we will try to explain rules of this beautiful game.</p>
  <p><h4>Setup</h4><b>1.</b> &emsp; Players spawn mainly diagonally in corners, but it is all up to you, they &emsp; &emsp; should just be evenly placed.</p>
  <p><h4>Actions</h4><b>1.</b> &emsp; Every turn you draw on the paper <b>2</b> actions (e. g. in the form of lines), &emsp; &emsp; you can save up to <b>20</b> actions, but you can use max. <b>10</b> actions in one &emsp; &emsp; turn.</p>
  <p><h4>Rules of conquering</h4><b>1.</b> &emsp; You expand by counquering fields (tiles). By default, for every action &emsp; &emsp; you conquer <b>1</b> field, you can jump over one field</p> <!--Tu by bolo možno dobré dať nejakú animáciu rozširovania sa. -->
