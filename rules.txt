Setup

You will need a pencil.
Spawns should be evenly placed.
Each turn you receive 2 actions.

Warehouse

Each player has a warehouse the size of actions per turn times 10.
You use the warehouse to store actions by taking notes.
The limit of actions you can spend per turn is 10 actions.
Used actions are crossed off.

Expansion

You expand by counquering tiles.
For 1 action you can conquer 1 empty tile.
You can conquer any tile at maximum 2 tiles away from your territory.
You don't move, you expand.

Conquering

Each tile has the power of 1 by default.
To capture a tile your attack has to be stronger than it's defence.
Neutral tiles require atleast the same power.
You attack and defend with all adjacent tiles.
The cost of conquering equals the cost of expansion.

Elements

The second layer.
They all have power.
It affects their size and required actions to conquer it.
You can't jump over elements unless you own them.
Mountains (brown, power 3).
Lakes (blue, power 2).
Castle (blackish, power 4) It's size is 1 or 2. Spawns in the feature layer.
Sweet woods (beige, power 2) Chopping down (crossing out) one tile provides one log and removes the element's power.

Features

Features are the top layer.
They don't cost anything.
Gold (gold) - Grants you an adjacent neutral feature- and elemenent-less tile.
Village (red) - Gives you loot in the form of actions.
Iron (gray).
Material (pink).

Resources
Can be saved in the warehouse taking up 5 spaces.
Log - from sweet woods. Used to build buildings.
Material - used to build a soldier.
Iron - Reinforces buildings providing them +1 power. Max one per building. Highlight the tile's edges to use.

Floorings

The first layer below everything.
Grass - filler flooring.
Desert - tile doesn't defend itself.
Snow - when used, expansion range is 1.
Water - Ports can be built there. Ships have +1 expansion range. Only ranged weapons can attack them from mainland. Attacking the coastline deals -1 attack.

Soldiers

Change the tile's behaviour.
Built by drawing the corresponding shape, using one material.
Attacker (triangle) - +1 attack.
Defender (circle) - +1 defence.
Bowman (D = bow) - 1 power is moved, not expaned, to the radius 2 around the tile. They can't shoot through anything that would block them (mountain, sweet woods).
Catapult (square) - Only 3 attack against structures explicitly in the range of 2. Requires open terrain.

Buildings

Built using resources.
Provide extra power and abilities.
You can't stack them.
Cottage (3) - Requires 2 logs. Must be placed on your territory.
Port (2) - One per sea per player. Allows you to enter water.

Other

Loosing your spawn means losing the game as well.
The game ends, when someone can't do anything anymore.
Spawns are random, without seeing the map first (turn the page upside down).
If there are more players than corners, choose spawns equidistant from each others.
