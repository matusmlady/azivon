Setup

Print the map and get a pencil.
Place your spawns evenly and randomly (turn the page upside down).
If there are more players than corners, choose spawns equidistantly.

Expansion

Each turn a player receives 2 actions.
They then expand by taking tiles.
Expanding to 1 empty tile costs you 1 action.
You can expand at maximum 2 tiles away from your territory.
You don't move, you expand.

Conquering

The default power of each tile is 1.
To conquer an opponent's tile your attack has to be higher than the opponent's defence.
Neutral tiles require the same attack as is the tile's defence.
You attack and defend with all adjacent tiles.
The cost of conquering equals the cost of expansion.

Elements

The second layer.
They all have power - it affects their size and the required actions to conquer them.
Mountains (brown, power 3).
Lakes (blue, power 2).
Castle (blackish, power 4). It's size varies (1 or 2). Spawns in the feature layer.
Sweet woods (beige, power 2). Chopping down (=crossing out) one tile provides one log and removes the element's power.
You can't jump over elements when expanding.
You however can go around them.

Features

Features are the top and third layer (the smallest).
They don't cost anything.
Gold (gold). People gather around. Grants you an adjacent neutral feature/elemenent-less tile.
Village (red). Gives you loot in the form of actions. Loot by crossing out loot next to the map.
Iron (gray). Resource.
Material (pink). Resource.

Resources

Log. Comes from sweet woods. Used to build buildings.
Material. Used to train soldiers.
Iron. Reinforces buildings providing them +1 power. Max one per building. To use highlight the tile's edges.
They can be saved in the warehouse taking up 5 spaces.

Warehouse

Each player has one the size of (actions per turn * 10).
It is used to store actions by taking notes.
At most 10 actions can be spent per turn.
Used actions are to be crossed off.

Floorings

The first layer below everything.
Grass. Just a filler flooring.
Desert. Water is scarce. Tile doesn't defend itself.
Snow. The temperatures are freezing and you can't exist here normally. When used during movement, expansion range is 1. Even when only starting there and moving on other terrain.
Water. Ports can be built here. Ships have +1 expansion range. Only ranged weapons can attack them from mainland. Attacking the coastline deals -1 attack.

Soldiers

Change the tile's behaviour.
Built by drawing the corresponding shape, using one material.
Attacker (triangle) - +1 attack.
Defender (circle) - +1 defence.
Bowman (D = bow) - 1 power is moved, not expaned, to the radius 2 around the tile. They can't shoot through anything that would block them (mountain, sweet woods).
Catapult (square) - Only 3 attack against structures explicitly in the range of 2. Requires open terrain.

Buildings

Built using resources.
Provide extra power and abilities.
You can't stack them.
Fortification (3). Requires 2 logs. Must be placed on your territory.
Port (2). One per sea per player. Allows you to enter water.

Other

Loosing your spawn means losing the game as well.
The game ends, when someone can't do anything anymore.
